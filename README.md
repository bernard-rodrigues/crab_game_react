# Crab Game

Crab Connect is a strategic board game where players move crabs across a 6x6 grid with the goal of getting four of their crabs in a row, either horizontally or vertically. Challenge a friend in two-player mode or test your skills against an AI opponent!

## 🦀 Features

- Two Player Mode: Play against a friend on the same board.
- AI Opponent: Challenge yourself against a computer-controlled opponent.
- Intuitive Movement: Crabs move horizontally or vertically until they hit another crab or the edge of the board.
- Dynamic Board: Visual indicators for available moves.
- Win Detection: Automatically identifies when a player achieves four in a row.
- Responsive Design: Enjoy the game on various screen sizes.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. Select a Game Mode: Choose between playing against another player or the AI.
2. Player Turns: Players take turns moving their crabs.
3. Move a Crab:
  - Click on one of your crabs to select it. The available squares it can move to will be highlighted.
  - Click on a highlighted square to move your crab there.
4. Winning the Game: The first player to get four of their crabs in a continuous row (horizontally or vertically) wins the game!
